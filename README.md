<!-- ENGINE GUIDE -->
## Engine Guide

This guide helps you to understand which Expansion Packs & Stuff Packs are working on each Engines
* EP1 is not working due to lack of University crack so Engines limited from Base, EP2 to EP8
* Highly recommended to backup your sims save before changing engine to avoid game corruption
* If worlds not loaded correctly remove old save and try again
