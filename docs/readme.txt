Update Readme: 03/May/2024

Latest EP9 Expansion (Mansion and Garden) is not working on Mobox NonWoW so we have to look for alternative to make it possible and here is the list that I created so hope it helps.
This game contains a lots of engines and you have to pay attetion not every engine possible to run newer expansions and stuff so check Part 3 for which exp and stuff you wanna go for.

* The Sims 2 Stuff Engines do not works, it means you only have to select one of expansions
* EP9 also doesnt work so latest engine to have all expansions is EP8
* for example if you go for EP3, all expansions and stuff after EP3 date (March 2006) not be available
like: SP3 and newer not work and only SP2 works

* Notes
EP1 is not working due to lack of University crack so Engines only limited from EP2 to EP8
EP9: EP9 Enigne isnt working on Mobox NonWoW - works on Mobox WoW64 without needing this file but lowest fps ever in May 2024 (useless & not playable)
